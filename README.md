# Locked-GEN / LGN
##### A contract for locking GENs. This contract converts GENs to Locked-GENs (LGNs) and back after a locking period.  

  - LGNs are standard ERC20 tokens that can be transferred freely.  
  - To redeem the LGNs back to GENs, one has to give the LGNs back to the contract and wait the locking time (2 years).  
  - The main intention of this contract is to give the Genesis DAO an option to distribute Locked-GENs to its members.  
  - A live interface to interact with the contracts can be found here. **ToDo**
